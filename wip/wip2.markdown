Path analysis, for instance, is notoriously noisy. As cited in [Web Analytics 2.0](https://www.webanalytics20.com/): “Path analysis turns out to be a terrible waste of time because the Web is not structured; it is chaotic. There isn’t one path to success; there are thousands. In addition, website owners define success on our site differently than our customers. This mismatch makes path analysis even more useless for unstructured experiences….tiny fractions of your converting Visitors followed too many different paths” (as in the figure below)
