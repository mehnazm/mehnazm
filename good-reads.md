# Good Reads 

Here is a list of links to content that I found really interesting. I will continue to add more, both old and new, and organize them into categories, over time.

1. [Are RCTs a good way to do economics](https://someunpleasant.substack.com/p/real-chaos-today?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=261003&post_id=59956889&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=9hzj0&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email) - I found this interesting because the concerns it articulates around RCTs parallel the ones I have with A/B testing.

2. [Complexity Convection](https://every.to/divinations/complexity-convection-765851) - This article stayed with me for its insights on the value of keeping products and businesses simple and the pressures and incentives that work against it.

3. [Disrupting Disruption](https://every.to/divinations/disrupting-disruption-734208) - A thought provoking challenge to Clayton Christensen's Disruption Theory. I liked the use of concrete examples such as Uber, iPhone, Costco, Walmart, Southwest Airlines.

4. [What Strategy Questions are You Asking](https://rogermartin.medium.com/what-strategy-questions-are-you-asking-587d32239a48) - I appreciated this article for highlighting that "moat" is dynamic and ever-changing. The true advantage lies in being ahead enough to ask and answer questions that competitors are not yet in a position to think about. It also asserts that a data advantage is really a questions advantage and that data analysis without a hypothesis is just data mining. This really resonated with me because speaking from experience, it's easy to fool ourselves and others with numbers and charts, mistaking complexity or effort for meaning. But that is ultimately noise. The framing—the questions—is the most important thing.

5. [Publishers and the Smiling Curve](https://stratechery.com/2014/publishers-smiling-curve/) - This is where I first learned about the Smiling Curve. Ben Thompson's application of the framework to the publishing industry is an eye-opener, as it makes you consider the commonalities between seemingly disconnected industries.
